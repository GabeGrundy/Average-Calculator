This is a simple calculator for averaging 3 numbers
it takes 3 numbers from the text boxes and outputs them as what the average number is between the 3 numbers
this calculator is in default, in dark mode. There are two buttons that can be used for changing the theme of the caululator for dark mode and light mode.
Light mode has a light gray backround and black text and dark mode has a dark bluish gray backround and white text.
